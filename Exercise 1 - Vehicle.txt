Dear course participants, 
 
Along with the course, I would like to work with you on a small program every week. In this way, you can practice the content you have learned right away. At the end of the week I will submit my solution to the exercise online. You can also comment on my solution or post your solution in the forum.

Here is the first task to repeat the content of the first part of the course:

Given is the following program:

#include "cstdlib"
#include "iostream" 
using namespace std; 

class Vehicle 
{ 
private:
string brand;
string licencePlate;
int ps;
int constructionYear;

public: 
void displayData(){ 
cout << "Brand: " << brand << endl;
cout << ãLicence Plate: " << licencePlate << endl;
cout << "PS: " << ps << endl;
cout << ãConstruction Year: " << constructionYear << endl; 
} 
}; 

int main(){ 

system("pause");
return 0; 
}; 


Modify and extend the program as follows: 

- Add a default constructor and constructor with a member initialization list to the class Vehicle.
- Create 2 instances of the class Vehicle (using the constructor with the member initialization list) and display the data on the screen.
- The program should have 3 classes: The program should have 3 classes: The base class Vehicle with already existing attributes, and 2 derived classes from the base class Vehicle: the class Car with an attribute maxSpeed of the data type float, and the class Truck with 2 attributes: maxLoad (float) and numberWheels (int). 
- For each new created class, define both the default constructor and the constructor with a member initialization list, as well as a member function to output the data displaydata().
- Create an instance of class Car and Truck and display the data on the screen.
Hint: Develop the program step by step. Compile the program after each intermediate step and check the desired result.
